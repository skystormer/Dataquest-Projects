## Dataquest Guided Projects

This repository is for the projects that I've completed in [dataquest.io](https://www.dataquest.io/). These challenges can be solved a number of different ways, and these solutions are merely one way of handling them. The projects include my explanations of the code as well as my thought processes as I progress through Dataquest's lessons. The projects (in Jupyter Notebook) are listed below.

**Project 1:** [Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets](https://github.com/skystormer/Dataquest-Projects/blob/master/Profitable_App_Profiles_for_the_App_Store_and_Google_Play_Markets.ipynb)
